#INTRO
The once radiant worlds of the galaxy now lie shrouded in the shadow of emptiness. The Dark Matter, a mysterious force, has consumed planets, toppled civilizations, and claimed countless souls. What remains of humanity seeks refuge among distant stars, hoping to escape the inevitable."

Jaxon Ryder, a veteran space pilot, lived far from this chaos on a remote colony with his wife, Elara. But one fateful day, everything changed. Elara vanished without a trace, taken by an unknown force hidden in the darkness.

Determined to save her, Ryder embarks on a perilous journey, following the trail of the mysterious attackers. Along the way, he uncovers horrifying truths: Dark Matter not only devours worlds but twists those it touches into monstrous beings.

What happened to Elara? Why was she taken, and by whom? As Ryder dives deeper into the realm of the Void Order, he realizes that not only the fate of the galaxy but also the fate of his love is at stake.

Now begins a journey into the darkest corners of the universe, where the ultimate question remains: Can you save the one you love from the darkness… or will everything be consumed by the Black Void?

#TALK1
Ryder: Elara... did you see where she went? She vanished in an instant, like she was never here.
Stranger: Elara? Hmm... doesn’t ring a bell. Who is she? And, who are you anyway?
Ryder: Jaxon Ryder. I’m her husband. I just need to know if you've seen anything unusual.
Stranger: Ah, Ryder, got it! But I’ve got no clue where she might’ve gone. Strange things have been happening around here lately, though.Shadows moving, people disappearing… wouldn’t be surprised if it’s all connected.
Ryder: Doesn't matter how long it takes or how far I have to go... I'm going to find her. This is just the beginning.
#PREKRONIS
Ryder: Kronis... I know you’re here! Show yourself! I’ve followed the trail of dark energy straight to this station. You can't hide forever.
Kronis: Ah, Ryder… so you've managed to find me. Brave, but foolish. Do you really think you can stand against time itself?
Ryder: I’m not here for riddles. You’re holding secrets about the Dark Matter… and about Elara. Tell me where she is, or I’ll tear this place apart until I find answers.
Kronis: Time is but a river, Ryder, and you've only begun to wade in its depths. You have no idea what you’re up against. But if it’s a fight you seek… step forward, and let’s see how long you last.
Ryder: Then let’s get started. For Elara.
#AFTERKRONIS
Kronis: You... you've managed to break through the flow of time itself... impressive, Ryder. But… you’ve only scratched the surface of the darkness that awaits.
Ryder: Enough games, Kronis. I’ve beaten you, now tell me what you know about Elara. Where is she?
Kronis: Elara... ah, you’re still clinging to hope. She’s beyond your reach, Ryder. The Dark Matter has claimed her… just as it will claim you.
Ryder: We’ll see about that. I’ll tear down every one of you if I have to. Where’s my next stop?
Kronis: Seek… Orion… in the storm-shrouded world of Vaelos. But beware, Ryder… some truths… are better left... buried.
Ryder: I’ll uncover every last one of them. Elara… I’m coming for you."
#PREORION
Ryder: So this is Vaelos... The very ground feels twisted by Dark Matter. Orion, show yourself! I know you’re here!
Orion: Brave to come here alone, Ryder. But bravery won’t protect you from gravity’s wrath. I control this world’s very essence.
Ryder: Cut the theatrics, Orion. I’m here for answers. Where’s Elara? What does the Order of the Void want with her? 
Orion: Ah… Elara, your precious light lost in darkness. She is beyond you, Ryder. Beyond this life, even. And if you continue… you’ll join her in the void.
Ryder: If I have to bring down your entire twisted Order to reach her, so be it. Let’s end this.
Orion: Very well, Ryder. Prepare to be shattered.
#AFTERORION
Ryder: Orion’s grasp over Vaelos is broken. You’re not so invincible after all.
Orion: Even in defeat, you learn nothing, Ryder. My fall only brings you closer to despair. Elara is no longer yours to save.
Ryder: Save your warnings. Each one of you I bring down brings me one step closer to her.
Orion: Fool. She is the very darkness you’re chasing. What you find may be beyond saving.
Ryder: I’ll decide that.
#PRENYX
Ryder: Nyx… I’ve come a long way to find you. I know who you really are.
Nyx: Do you? And yet you stand here, believing in a past that no longer exists. Elara is gone, Ryder. There’s only me now.
Ryder: Maybe you’ve buried her, but I know she’s still in there. I won’t leave without her.
Nyx: How noble. But you’re chasing a ghost. She embraced the darkness long ago. If you think you can bring her back… then come and try.
#AFTERNYX
Elara: Ryder... you found me. Even after all this... you never gave up.
Ryder: I came to bring you back, Elara. We can fight this—together.
Elara: But it’s not that simple. The Dark Matter... it's taken root. I’m part of it now. If I stay, the galaxy’s at risk. If you save the galaxy... I’m lost.
Ryder: No... there has to be a way. I won’t let you go again.
Elara: The choice is yours, Ryder. Save me, and the darkness spreads, risking everything we tried to protect. Or... save the galaxy, and let me go. Whatever you decide, know that I’ve loved you beyond anything else.
#KILLELARA
Ryder: Elara… I tried everything. But I can’t sacrifice the entire galaxy. I know you’d choose the same.
Elara: Ryder… I understand why you have to do this. And though I’m part of the darkness now, my heart will always be yours. We part ways, but I’ll be with you, wherever you go.
Ryder: Elara… I’ll never forget you. For the world, and for what we shared.
Elara: True love will always be a part of you. Remember me… in the light.
#SAVEELARA
Ryder: Elara, I choose you. The darkness may seem unstoppable, but with you by my side, I can face anything.
Elara: Ryder… I know what this costs. The galaxy may never forgive us, but at least we’ll face it together.
Ryder: We’ll fight whatever comes our way, together. Even if it’s the end of the world, I want to be with you.
Elara: The world may turn against us, but you found me when no one else could. Let’s face it, Ryder. Together, even in the shadow of darkness, we are free…
