#INTRO
The once radiant worlds of the galaxy now lie shrouded in the shadow of emptiness. The Dark Matter, a mysterious force, has consumed planets, toppled civilizations, and claimed countless souls. What remains of humanity seeks refuge among distant stars, hoping to escape the inevitable."

Jaxon Ryder, a veteran space pilot, lived far from this chaos on a remote colony with his wife, Elara. But one fateful day, everything changed. Elara vanished without a trace, taken by an unknown force hidden in the darkness.

Determined to save her, Ryder embarks on a perilous journey, following the trail of the mysterious attackers. Along the way, he uncovers horrifying truths: Dark Matter not only devours worlds but twists those it touches into monstrous beings.

What happened to Elara? Why was she taken, and by whom? As Ryder dives deeper into the realm of the Void Order, he realizes that not only the fate of the galaxy but also the fate of his love is at stake.

Now begins a journey into the darkest corners of the universe, where the ultimate question remains: Can you save the one you love from the darkness… or will everything be consumed by the Black Void?

Ryder: Elara... did you see where she went? She vanished in an instant, like she was never here.
Stranger: Elara? Doesn’t ring a bell... Who are you, anyway, son? Don’t think I’ve seen you before.
Ryder: I’m... Jaxon. Jaxon Ryder, her husband!" Or... wait, maybe that’s not quite right... call me whatever you want.
Stranger: Ah, now I’ve got it! But I’ve got no clue where she might’ve gone. Strange things have been happening around here lately.
Ryder: Doesn't matter how long it takes or how far I have to go... I'm going to find her. This is just the beginning.
